# Pizza-Website
PROBLEM
 
With the COVID-19 pandemic limiting face-to-face commercial transactions, small enterprises require an internet presence now more than ever. More than one-quarter of small firms (28%) do not have a website. In 2021, a high-quality website will be even more important, and small firms will need to grow staff to stay up with client expectations and demand.
 
 INTRODUCTION
 
This project is about a food(Pizza) website. I was contacted by a family friend who lives in North Carolina for a startup website draft. The time it takes to take and serve orders is excessive, and the efficiency of human work and overall profit are not balanced.
In the food industry, quality control is required.Here the shopkeeper can visit the website and can make pizza orders for their customers.The shopkeeper will be able to add new products(Pizza type) and can edit or delete also after some time.Once the Shopkeeper is ready to complete the order for his/her customers he will be able to make the order and can print the bill for that order.This project will help the Shopkeepers to increase production speed, overall profit and quality control.
